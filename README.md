# Kentico Kontent Documentation - Samples Manager
Backend service for Kentico Kontent [documentation portal](https://docs.kontent.ai/), which utilizes Kentico Kontent as a source of its data.

Together with [GitHub Reader](https://github.com/KenticoDocs/kontent-docs-github-reader), this service is responsible for maintaining Kentico Kontent content items that represent code samples used in Kentico Kontent documentation portal. 
Samples Manager responds to changes in the stored code samples in [Azure Blob Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/blobs/) and then updates content items in Kentico Kontent project accordingly.

## Overview
1. This project is a JavaScript Azure Durable Functions application.
2. After the [GitHub Reader](https://github.com/KenticoDocs/kontent-docs-github-reader) saves changed code samples in the storage, Samples Manager updates content items in Kentico Kontent project using [Content Management API](https://docs.kontent.ai/reference/content-management-api-v2).
3. This service is subscribed to a _Blob Created_ event type which is fired when GitHub Sync stores code samples to the Azure Blob Storage.
4. In order to handle many code samples at once, the service is written as an [Azure Durable function](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/durable/durable-functions-overview) that executes a sequence of functions in a specific order. Each of those functions will process only a specified amount of code samples.
